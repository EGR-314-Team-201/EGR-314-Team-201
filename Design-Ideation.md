# Design Ideation
At the initiation of our design ideation process, our team gathered on Google Jamboard for a brainstorming session. During this collaborative session, team members freely exchanged ideas, leveraging the digital platform to visually illustrate and organize our collective thoughts. The synergy of our diverse perspectives fueled a dynamic exchange, leading to the exploration of numerous creative concepts and potential design directions. The accompanying image captures a snapshot of this dynamic brainstorming session, showcasing the collaborative and interactive nature of our initial design discussions.

Throughout our brainstorming session our team discussed about key aspects we wanted to prioritize for our device. Functionality, safety, and convenience emerged as the three primary pillars that would guide our design process. Recognizing the significance of these elements, we initiated the process of organizing our brainstorming session, laying the foundation for a structured approach towards achieving our design goals.

By prioritizing functionality, we ensure that the (weather station) delivers accurate and comprehensive data, meeting the primary objective of providing valuable insights into atmospheric conditions. The emphasis on safety follows, acknowledging the critical importance of reliable and secure data transmission, a weather-resistant design, and an effective emergency alert system to protect users from potential hazards. Finally, placing convenience as a top criterion recognizes the significance of user experience, ensuring that the weather station is not only technologically advanced but also easy to use, portable, and sustainable. This ranking reflects a holistic approach that addresses the core functionalities, safety considerations, and user-friendly aspects, ultimately leading to the development of a (mobile weather station) that excels in performance, reliability, and user satisfaction.


# Product Concept Sketches
## Product Concept #1
![Product Concept #1](https://github.com/EGR-314-Team-201/EGR-314-Team-201/assets/156974933/4e02827d-355f-4101-8eb2-951e5dfcdb9d)

Description: This innovation serves as a designated holder for your beverage. A side panel is utilized to configure the preferred temperature for your drink, whether it requires heating or cooling. Upon activation, the bottom heat pad and the side fan and coolant work in tandem. A probe is employed to monitor the current drink temperature, signaling when it reaches the desired temperature.


## Product Concept #2

Description: This conceptual prototype showcases a versatile device capable of adjusting liquid temperature according to user preferences. It incorporates various components, including a heating pad, temperature sensors, a fan, and an LED display, all seamlessly connected to a microcontroller. The detachable lid houses the LED display and top-mounted fan for efficient cooling. The heating pad encircles the cup, providing targeted warmth, while the temperature sensor resides at the bottom. The microcontroller is housed in its dedicated compartment below. A strategically positioned straw accommodates the top fan, ensuring uninterrupted functionality. This design prioritizes user convenience, offering a compact and user-friendly experience. Additionally, users can remotely control the cup settings through WiFi connectivity.



## Product Concept #3

Description: This container is specifically engineered to regulate the temperature of the liquid stored in its water tank. Users can conveniently add or dispense liquid through the top outlet. The top of the container features an interface for manual temperature control, allowing users to set their preferred temperature. A built-in temperature sensor continuously monitors the liquid's temperature, enabling the system to determine whether heating or cooling is necessary. In the case of cooling, the motor subsystem activates the cooling fan, effectively lowering the temperature. Conversely, if heating is required, an internal heating component raises the liquid temperature to the user's specified level. The motor subsystem is securely sealed with a protective cover on top, ensuring leak-proofing and preventing water ingress. The container's interior is crafted from thermally conductive materials, enhancing the cooling efficiency, while the exterior is enveloped in thermal insulation materials. This not only safeguards users from potential heat but also helps retain the desired temperature within the container.
