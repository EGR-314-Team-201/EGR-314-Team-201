# Design Ideation
At the initiation of our design ideation process, our team gathered on Google Jamboard for a brainstorming session. During this collaborative session, team members freely exchanged ideas, leveraging the digital platform to visually illustrate and organize our collective thoughts. The synergy of our diverse perspectives fueled a dynamic exchange, leading to the exploration of numerous creative concepts and potential design directions. The accompanying image captures a snapshot of this dynamic brainstorming session, showcasing the collaborative and interactive nature of our initial design discussions.

Throughout our brainstorming session our team discussed about key aspects we wanted to prioritize for our device. Functionality, safety, and convenience emerged as the three primary pillars that would guide our design process. Recognizing the significance of these elements, we initiated the process of organizing our brainstorming session, laying the foundation for a structured approach towards achieving our design goals.

By prioritizing functionality, we ensure that the (weather station) delivers accurate and comprehensive data, meeting the primary objective of providing valuable insights into atmospheric conditions. The emphasis on safety follows, acknowledging the critical importance of reliable and secure data transmission, a weather-resistant design, and an effective emergency alert system to protect users from potential hazards. Finally, placing convenience as a top criterion recognizes the significance of user experience, ensuring that the weather station is not only technologically advanced but also easy to use, portable, and sustainable. This ranking reflects a holistic approach that addresses the core functionalities, safety considerations, and user-friendly aspects, ultimately leading to the development of a (mobile weather station) that excels in performance, reliability, and user satisfaction.
