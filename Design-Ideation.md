# Design Ideation
At the initiation of our design ideation process, our team gathered on Google Jamboard for a brainstorming session. During this collaborative session, team members freely exchanged ideas, leveraging the digital platform to visually illustrate and organize our collective thoughts. The synergy of our diverse perspectives fueled a dynamic exchange, leading to the exploration of numerous creative concepts and potential design directions. The accompanying image captures a snapshot of this dynamic brainstorming session, showcasing the collaborative and interactive nature of our initial design discussions.

Throughout our brainstorming session our team discussed about key aspects we wanted to prioritize for our device. Functionality, safety, and convenience emerged as the three primary pillars that would guide our design process. Recognizing the significance of these elements, we initiated the process of organizing our brainstorming session, laying the foundation for a structured approach towards achieving our design goals.

By prioritizing functionality, we ensure that the (weather station) delivers accurate and comprehensive data, meeting the primary objective of providing valuable insights into atmospheric conditions. The emphasis on safety follows, acknowledging the critical importance of reliable and secure data transmission, a weather-resistant design, and an effective emergency alert system to protect users from potential hazards. Finally, placing convenience as a top criterion recognizes the significance of user experience, ensuring that the weather station is not only technologically advanced but also easy to use, portable, and sustainable. This ranking reflects a holistic approach that addresses the core functionalities, safety considerations, and user-friendly aspects, ultimately leading to the development of a (mobile weather station) that excels in performance, reliability, and user satisfaction.


# Product Concept Sketches
## Product Concept #1
![Product Concept #1](https://github.com/EGR-314-Team-201/EGR-314-Team-201/assets/156974933/4e02827d-355f-4101-8eb2-951e5dfcdb9d)

Description: This concept acts as something to place your drink in. The panel on the side will be used to set the desired temperature for your drink. Depending on whether the drink should be heated or cooled. The heat pad on the bottom and the fan and coolant on the side will activate. To get to the correct temperature, a probe is used to check the current temperature of the drink and see once the drink reaches the desired temperature.


## Product Concept #2

Description: In this design prototype, it shows a device able to heat up and cool liquid based off of the user's preference. There are several systems that will be integrated into the device including a heating pad, temperature sensors, a fan, and an LED display. These will all be connected into the microcontroller. The lid which will be detachable holds the LED display and the fan, cooling from above. The heating pad will settle around the cup, heating against the material. The temperature sensor will rest at the bottom, with the microcontroller in its own compartment underneath. There will be a straw entering from the side to accommodate for the fan being on top, ensuring the product doesn't run interrupted. This design responds to user needs by keeping the product compact and simple to operate. The user will be able to also operate the settings of the cup through wifi.

Description: This container is designed to heat or cool the liquid inside the water tank. Users can add or dispense liquid from the outlet on the top of the container. There is also an interface on the top for users to manually control the temperature that they want to set up. A temperature sensor will measure the temperature inside the container and allow the system to determine whether it's needed to heat up or cool down. If cooling is required, the motor subsystem will work to drive the cooling fan and decrease the temperature. If heating is needed, the heating component inside will heat up the liquid to the user-desired temperature. The motor subsystem will be sealed with a protective cover on top of it to ensure leak-proofing and prevent water ingress. The interior is made of thermally conductive materials for a better cooling effect, and the exterior is wrapped with thermal insulation materials to protect the user or remain heat.
