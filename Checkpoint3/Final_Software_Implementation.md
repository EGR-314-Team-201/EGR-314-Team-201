Discuss how the functionality of this software diagram satisfies user needs and product requirements though an in depth discussion of function



Numbered list of the top 5 biggest changes to your software design since the software proposal. Include several sentences for each change describing the issue and how you resolved it. Use the UML diagrams above to support the discussion.








If you were to create a "Version 2.0" of your software design, discuss what could be improved in the software design and why it should be improved. Use the UML diagrams above to support the discussion. Consider using a graphical representation of the flow that your updated software would take. What functions would you create? How would you divide up your code? How would you improve its debuggability? What peripherals or system features would you like to use or set up to make your system more reliable, stable, functional, or robust? How would you simplify, improve, or update your protocol design to support this in software? (Â½ page minimum)
