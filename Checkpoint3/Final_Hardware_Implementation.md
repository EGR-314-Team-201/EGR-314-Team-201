Discuss how the functionality of this schematic satisfies user needs and product requirements though an in depth discussion of function.
Discuss your team's design and decision making process related to this section

This semester we were assigned with creating a mobile weather station, so our group decided to think outside the box and created a mobile weather station for your drink. Introducing the BevRight, The BevRight System incorporates a wide range of compoenets to help ensure effecitve temperature reguation for beverages. The BOSCH BME280 Humidity sensor and DSB1820 One Wire temperature sensor provide accuracte measurements, while the LCD display offers a user-friendly interface for temperature monitoring. The FIT0844 Heating Element along with the Peltier TEC Cooling unit, enables the system to adjust the beverage temperatures as desired. The MIC4574WU Buck Regulator ensures stable power delivery from the 12V AC-DC Wall power supply, while the Axial 80mm Fan helps to dissipate heat and cool the module. This design allows the user to easily control and maintain temperature of whatver beverage they may be drinking.

If you were to create a "Version 2.0" of your hardware design, discuss what could be improved in the hardware design and why it should be improved. Use the schematic above to support the discussion. (Â½ page minimum)

One key improvement could be implementing a more efficent power management system, instead of using 12V AC-DC wall power supply we use something like a battery so that we can market it as being a mobile- on the go device. We could use a rechargeable battery and include pwoer-saving features to improve portability and help to reduce the energy consumption. Some of the original trace locations and connectrions were not correct and needed to be adjusted with outside wires. Addtioionally, adding in a deticated power switch and LEDs to show each of the components getting power would be a priority for annother revision. For the overalll design, we would also like to add in a better enclosure for the device which woud protect the circuit board while allowingg the user to still interact with all of the buttons.
