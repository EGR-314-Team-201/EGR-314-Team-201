|These bottles have a good tight seal and the size was just right for taking along on a long drive or a day working outdoors . The colors are great . The finish and construction are durable . I always pre heat with super hot water prior to filling it with my favorite coffee . Then make sure to keep the bottle wrapped in a towel or a jacket for extra warmth . Keeps your hot beverage nice and hot all day and often into the following morning if it is kept warm|

|This is a great durable product. I have this and a small soup 16oz thermos as well. I used for hot tea and soup for my father while he was hospitalized and to take during his chemo sessions. It really came in so handy and reliable for keeping things hot. However, one suggestion would be to maybe add ridges or a handle to the cover. It can be a bit hard to open - a bit slippery for older people. Otherwise, highly recommend for keeping drinks/soups hot!|

|I love this thermos design. The shape design makes it easy to sand on its own and you don’t have to worry about it tipping over. The color is beautiful. It’s super easy to use. The cup twist off super easy and does in my hand perfect. The liquid holding capacity is perfect too. It’s not too little wishing you had another thermos bottle and it’s not too big and bulky.|

|The thermos handle is too loose. It's dangerous. It's so loose when you are opening the container would hot liquid. It could be poured all over you because the handle just flops around... I'm terribly sorry I would not recommend it to anyone. And I believe it was a product.|

|So if I were to rate this based upon only keeping my coffee hot all day, it get a A. What you should know is that due to the plastic plug top which has 2 air vents, it is prone to leak unless its screwed in like your life depends upon it. This plug and its vents also cause the pour to splash out in all directions when held where they are't perfectly horizontal, which you can't see them to determine if they are straight. When it comes out splashing, it will splash everything close to your cup. I wipe my desk and cup off twice a day.|

|I wanted stainless steel to avoid chemicals/chemical smells in my boiled water that I keep for tea. This bottle is nice stainless steel, but the lid insert is plastic. You unscrew it after putting hot water into it and the heated/melted plastic smell is sickening. The water tastes like it, even though I made sure not to fill it high enough to touch the plastic insert and I completely unscrewed it instead of pouring the water out through the plastic.|
