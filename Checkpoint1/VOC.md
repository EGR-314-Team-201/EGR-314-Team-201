### Positive Reviews  
_____  
|These bottles have a good tight seal and the size was just right for taking along on a long drive or a day working outdoors . The colors are great . The finish and construction are durable . I always pre heat with super hot water prior to filling it with my favorite coffee . Then make sure to keep the bottle wrapped in a towel or a jacket for extra warmth . Keeps your hot beverage nice and hot all day and often into the following morning if it is kept warm|

|This is a great durable product. I have this and a small soup 16oz thermos as well. I used for hot tea and soup for my father while he was hospitalized and to take during his chemo sessions. It really came in so handy and reliable for keeping things hot. However, one suggestion would be to maybe add ridges or a handle to the cover. It can be a bit hard to open - a bit slippery for older people. Otherwise, highly recommend for keeping drinks/soups hot!|

|I love this thermos design. The shape design makes it easy to sand on its own and you don’t have to worry about it tipping over. The color is beautiful. It’s super easy to use. The cup twist off super easy and does in my hand perfect. The liquid holding capacity is perfect too. It’s not too little wishing you had another thermos bottle and it’s not too big and bulky.|


### Negative Reviews  

|The thermos handle is too loose. It's dangerous. It's so loose when you are opening the container would hot liquid. It could be poured all over you because the handle just flops around... I'm terribly sorry I would not recommend it to anyone. And I believe it was a product.|

|So if I were to rate this based upon only keeping my coffee hot all day, it get a A. What you should know is that due to the plastic plug top which has 2 air vents, it is prone to leak unless its screwed in like your life depends upon it. This plug and its vents also cause the pour to splash out in all directions when held where they are't perfectly horizontal, which you can't see them to determine if they are straight. When it comes out splashing, it will splash everything close to your cup. I wipe my desk and cup off twice a day.|

|I wanted stainless steel to avoid chemicals/chemical smells in my boiled water that I keep for tea. This bottle is nice stainless steel, but the lid insert is plastic. You unscrew it after putting hot water into it and the heated/melted plastic smell is sickening. The water tastes like it, even though I made sure not to fill it high enough to touch the plastic insert and I completely unscrewed it instead of pouring the water out through the plastic.|

### Positive Reviews  

|“I read the reviews and was expecting this to have a temperature problem, but Honestly i have no idea why people were so sensitive about it. It heated the water, I don't use a thermometer, but it was steaming and boiling hot when I opened it. Boiling as in still had bubbles. It isn't very much water compared to my water kettle in my kitchen at home, but it is travel size and I don't want it to be that big. It traveled well, and was easy to clean and pack up at the end of the week. Really happy I purchased this for my trip.”|

|“SO worth it. I've been using this almost everyday since it arrived, and I love it so much! It fits in the water bottle side-pocket of my backpack, and is surprisingly VERY quiet during heating. Easy to clean, and does well with every tea bag I've thrown in it. Would definitely buy again!”|

|“Great for power outages (use with Jackery power bank) or for traveling. Boils water quickly and really does get as hot as it says. I had to learn to adjust the temp down a bit for my water for tea. Very well-made, easy to use. Only thing that would've been better is if it had a cup to drink out of.”|

### Negative Reviews  
_____  

|“I was really excited to take the Jettle with me on vacation to Iceland to heat water for coffee and tea. I realized from the 1st use that I could not feel the button to control the temperature - I just had to press it in the temp general area provided, which I think is a major design flaw. Unfortunately, because a touchable temperature button is not provided, I could not increase the temperature on the kettle in time before it started heating the liquid in time - it stayed on 40 degrees for baby milk heating. Then, by my 4th use, the Jettle broke when I plugged it into the electric socket converter. I had to throw it out. I'll be honest that it was easy to clean though. Overall, a waste of money.”|

|The product is excellent. The problem is that my hand can’t fit to clean the bottom. After use, it creates a dark, warm, moist, environment perfect for bacteria to grow. In minutes, I can see the bacterial colonies forming. If this product came with a flexible scrub or cleaner, or if there was one to purchase, I’d give it 5 stars.|

|“This is what I do and it consistently works on the cup. Put your coffee in the cup. Turn the cup on by pressing and holding the button on the bottom. Press the button on the side of the cup to move the temperature on the cup to the max. THEN PRESS HOLD AND RELEASE the button on the side of the cup to turn on the red light on the cup showing that it is heating. Then quickly press the button on the side of the cup to set your desired temperature. I always have a problem turning the cup on when the coffee is hotter than my desired temperature setting. This process has not failed yet. I love my cup.” 5/5|

|“This mug is life-changing. It's a sturdy, comfortable mug that will keep your coffee/beverage hot without feeling hot-to-the-touch and without the necessity of carrying around a separate warming-coaster. In short, it does what it says it will do. Warning: The directions could be much clearer and, because of that, there is a bit of a learning curve to learn what to push where to turn the mug on, heat the mug, and keep it at temperature. The negative reviews out there stating that the product doesn't work clearly come from those who have either not read the directions (shame on them) or who didn't understand the directions (understandable - the product is very user-friendly but the directions are unduly confusing). Like other brands of "hot-mugs", the product may be controlled through an app on your phone. Fortunately, unlike other brands of "hot-mugs", use of the app is not necessary -- instead, you can just press 'buttons' on the mug itself to control the heat/temperature (makes sense -- you're touching the mug already to use it -- why bring your phone into the mix?). I have no idea how user-friendly the app is - never saw the need to download it. If I had either the time or the inclination, I would post my own written directions for the mug or, better yet, post a quick video to show how user-friendly this mug really is --- but I have neither. Just believe me - this mug does what it says it will do. Finally, you can stroll around the house with your mug, sit on your front porch, get interrupted by a long phone call, and come back to hot coffee. Life-changing!!” 5/5|

|“I am pretty savvy with electronic devices, apps to run them, etc. As at least 1 prior reviewer mentioned, I could not get the cup to work. Uninstalled the app, reinstalled it, said it connected, and the charging light on the plug in came on appropriately. I charged it for 22 hours and still the mug and base and/or charger did not sync. When I poured a hot mug of coffee, the digital temp on the mug did not display. I didn't bother to open the 2nd one I ordered and both are going back.” 2/5|

|“Heats from the sides instead of the bottom. Therefore, as you drink the coffee, the heater loses contact with the beverage. After half a cup no longer has enough contact to heat the beverage adequately adequately. On top of that, right out of the box, some of the digital lighting display was blown out.....JUNK” 1/5|

### Positive Reviews  
_____  
|I often eat breakfast burritos on the way to work. I thought this would be great for the drink I get when I go to my favorite restaurant , however their cups are not made of metal therefore not very conductive to the drink warming apparatus|

|I love this cup cooler! If you're looking for something to keep your beverages cold in the car, then look no further! It is very easy to use, one button for heat one button for cold. This product has a metal plate inside that cools so well it can actually get a little Frosty to the touch. It is so awesome that my husband stole it for energy drinks in his car and I had to buy another one! The only downside is that it only has a cigarette lighter power cord, it would have been nice if it was compatible with a power cord for the house so I could use it in the office.|

|The vents must be completely exposed when the product sits in your car's cup holder. Any obstruction of these vents will stop its cooling ability. If necessary, make something to prop up the product so the vents are open to the air.A cover is necessary to keep the cold air around the can. This could be 3D printed. Ideally, the manufacturer could supply one.|

### Negative Reviews  
_____  
|Hate when a great idea is improperly executed. This is just the ticket. pour in a little water that will freeze and conduct heat to the can, keeping your drink more than cool, ice cold. Except that the power connector to the cup is tiny, can't handle the current, heats up enough to burn my finger and eventually melts the plastic resulting in a failure. This is not only a failure point, it is a safety hazard. Other than the obvious and easily preventable engineering failure, it's perfect. Simply using a proper connector would have solved this.|

|It works okay on a closed container. It cools the bottom and then you have to mix it a little to distribute the cold temperature. I have not tried the hot feature. When on cold you hear a fan noise during operation. I tried cooling an open can of soda and it was hard to cool the whole container because I couldn't mix the temperatures. It is stable in the cup holder. After a few minutes of use the outside of the electric cup starts to get a little warm near the plug. Over all I would not buy this again.|

|I should of read the description better, I thought there maybe inserts for each size of cups.I placed a medium size dunkin donuts cup in it it covered 1/4 cup high.|

|“Bought this to use when I stay with my 97yo Mom in hospital and now use every day! This thing can cook from scratch and, with batteries, is very incognito. Have tested recipes for beans, grains, pasta that pack tiny and this thing can cook!! When I return to my off grid lifestyle expect to also use it just as much and soak up excess solar and alternator power in those cute little batteries. Only complaint is will need to use bulky inverter but maybe a 12 volt slow charger will come along. And as good as the cup is the customer service is even better! Lot’s questions to help with buying decision were answered nearly instantly! Can’t wait to see what innovative things these guys develop!”|

|“I love the Hot Kup. It's very easy to use - I downloaded the Hot Kup app. I've pressed the "boil" button and it worked really well. The Hot Kup heats coffee up or keeps it warm. It makes like really easy, especially if you're sitting at your desk at work. You can heat up the Hot Kup to make tea, for example. It's sleek, and it shows the temperature on the Hot Kup as well. I really like it!”|

|“Self-heating electric cup.
Hot Kup brand, model‎HK WH, made in China.

Pros:
+ Aesthetics;
+ Quality of materials;
+ LED display;
+ Touch controls;
+ Control via App;
+ CE logo present.

Cons:
- Info and instructions in English;
- App downloadable only from the Play Store USA;
- App with several bugs; - Slow to heat up;

- The cork does not hold if it spills;
- Battery to be purchased separately;
- The cork does not hold if you spill the cup.|

|Perplexed by this product that aesthetically and qualitatively is very well done.. but in practical use I don't see much usefulness/practicality, especially for the sale price!

In practice, it is like a classic kettle but in miniature, it has its own electric base with a large and bulky 65 Watt external power supply.. as soon as you place the cup it is activated and the Display turns on with the temperature indication.. next to this (very little visible) there are the touch controls for the temperature + and -.

The temperature is set by default in degrees Fahrenheit and to change it to centigrade you need to download the app of the same name “Hot Kup” and here the “nice” begins.
This App does not exist on the Italian Android Play Store.. I found the link on the manufacturer's website that leads to the US Play Store and from here I installed it.. fortunately it does not require the creation of accounts or other data other than geolocation.
The connectivity is good and immediate.. the App is only in English and has few functions and some important bugs.
The main page has shortcut keys such as ON/OFF and to set the main functions that are those of using 'drink coffee', 'drink tea', 'drink chocolate', those for preparing 'make coffee', 'prepare tea', 'prepare chocolate', finally there are the functions of 'water purify' and that of 'boiling'.
In addition to this, you can only give a name to the cup and precisely set the F° or the C°, setting the temperature is a disaster, the interface does not work well and useless in this.

It takes 15 to 20 minutes to heat up the barely 400ml of maximum liquid it can hold, for example, a classic kettle takes half the time to boil twice as much water.
I tried to simulate the spilling of the cup and, surprise surprise, the cork comes off immediately pouring out the contents.. the sealing gasket when it heats up no longer holds!!|

|Honestly, I don't see a real use in this product, it just serves to keep the drink warm but at an unreasonable price for me.. maybe it's good for the Americans or the British..”|
