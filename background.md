# Background


## Introduction
Our mission is to design a cutting-edge mobile weather station, integrating serial sensors and actuation for dynamic environmental response. We are committed to sensing at least two environmental conditions with precision, utilizing advanced motor control protocols. Our goal is to not only meet academic requirements but to pioneer innovative, impactful solutions in environmental monitoring, broadcasting valuable data over the internet through MQTT. Join us in shaping a future where technology leads to a smarter world.
