## Mission Statement 

Our mission is to design a cutting-edge mobile weather station, integrating serial sensors and actuation for dynamic environmental response. We are committed to sensing at least two environmental conditions with precision, utilizing advanced motor control protocols. Our goal is to not only meet academic requirements but to pioneer innovative, impactful solutions in environmental monitoring, broadcasting valuable data over the internet through MQTT. Join us in shaping a future where technology leads to a smarter world.

Steps taken to build Mission Statement:

1) We conducted a brainstorming session to identify the main problem, the project vision, and the project deliverables.
2) We assigned roles and responsibilities to each team member based on their skills and interests.
3) We defined the project goals and objectives using the SMART criteria (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound).
4) We conducted a market research to analyze the current situation, the target audience, and the competitors.
5) We developed a business case to justify the project’s feasibility, benefits, and risks.
6) We outlined the project scope by listing the project activities, resources, and milestones.
7) We created a project timeline using a Gantt chart to show the start and end dates of each task and the dependencies among them.
8) We estimated the project budget by calculating the costs of labor, materials, equipment, and contingencies.
9) We noted the key assumptions and constraints that could affect the project’s success, such as the availability of data, the quality of the deliverables, and the stakeholder feedback.

## Team Meeting Coordination
* Contact group through class period 
* Contact the group through discord or text message
* Face to face meetings can do online if need be
* We will additionally set up a discord server to further communicate with each other and remind each other of meetings coming up in the future as well as providing a reliable way to communicate with one another

## Roles and Responsibilities
- Joseph Pelle: Project monitor
- Erik Alegria: Meeting leader/recorder
- Hunter Janisch: Assignment leader
- Houyu Zhang: Assignment editor/finalizer

## Accountability
Our approach involves assigning responsibilities to each role in a flexible manner, facilitating easy reassignment as required. Initially, roles were determined on a voluntary basis, with the first team member volunteering for a role being assigned that responsibility. Additionally, we can interchange roles as necessary. In our meetings, we discuss and identify team members who require assistance and the specific support needed.

### Team Coordination & Accountability:
* Each and every assignment will undergo a review process with the team as a whole. The group will decide whether or not an assignment is complete and is ready for submission. If a team member objects to an assignment submission, it will go through a review process that breaks down the assignment by every detail, making sure that it is complete and ready to be submitted.
* Skill and knowledge of an assignment will be verbally distributed either in-person or remotely. If a team member feels that they don’t have the skill and knowledge to complete a task, the team will comprise the workload in order to complete the assignment by the assigned deadline.
* Any feedback that is presented to the group will be distributed to every team member to ensure that the entire team is on the same page. If a team member is absent either in class or during a meeting time, information will be passed down to that individual. 

### Upon identifying an underperforming team member:
* A team meeting will be convened to address concerns and communicate observations.
* The team will discuss the impact of the underperformance and collaboratively problem-solve.
* Support will be provided to aid the team members in overcoming challenges.
* Emphasis will be placed on individual accountability and ownership of responsibilities.
* Future communication will be encouraged to foster an open dialogue.
* Follow-up sessions will be conducted to ensure the team member is on track and making progress.

### In the event that improvement is not observed:
* Consequences may include formal measures such as a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) or, ultimately, termination from the team (e.g., pink slip).
* If the team member facing performance challenges does not exhibit improvement, we will initiate a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), akin to a formal warning. The PIP will be a systematic strategy detailing explicit performance expectations, identified areas for enhancement, and a set timeline for progress. Failure to meet the outlined goals within the PIP will prompt a discussion with the Professor, ultimately leading to termination from the team.

### Conflict Recognition and Resolution:
* Acknowledge and openly address any disagreements as they arise.
* Resolve conflicts within the team promptly during the semester.
* Identify instances when an issue should be elevated to the instructor for resolution.
